## How EDHTop16 Works

### Data Collection
EDHTop16 aggregates tournament data from multiple sources:
- **TopDeck.gg** - Major tournament platform for competitive Commander
- **Additional tournament platforms** providing comprehensive cEDH coverage
- Tournament data is normalized and processed nightly

### Data Processing
- Tournaments are validated and deduplicated
- Commander names are normalized using Scryfall Oracle IDs
- Decklists are parsed from multiple formats (structured data and raw text)
- Statistics are calculated across all tournament entries
- Play rates are computed for the last year of tournament data

### Data Quality
- Duplicate entries are prevented
- Commander names are unified across different spellings
- Card data is validated against Scryfall
- Statistics are recalculated nightly for accuracy

## Key Metrics Explained

### Meta Share
Percentage of total tournament entries playing a specific commander.

**Formula:** `(entries with commander) / (total entries) × 100`

**Example:** If 50 out of 1000 tournament entries played Kinnan, the meta share is 5%.

### Conversion Rate
Percentage of tournament entries that made top cut (typically top 16 or top 8).

**Formula:** `(entries that made top cut) / (total entries with commander) × 100`

**Example:** If 15 out of 50 Kinnan entries made top cut, the conversion rate is 30%.

### Play Rate
Percentage of decks that include a specific card.

**Formula:** `(decks with card) / (total decks in color identity) × 100`

**Example:** If 80 out of 100 blue decks play Rhystic Study, the play rate is 80%.

### Winrate
Overall win percentage accounting for wins, losses, and draws.

**Formula:** `wins / (wins + losses + draws) × 100`

**Example:** A player with 10 wins, 5 losses, and 2 draws has a 58.8% winrate.

### Card Winrate Comparison
Compares average winrate of decks that include vs exclude a specific card.

**Purpose:** Identify which cards actually improve your chances of winning.

**Example:** Decks with Dockside Extortionist might have a 62% winrate, while decks without it have 55%.
